                Magtymguly Pyragy (Persian: مختومقلی فراغی Makhtumqoli Faraghi; Turkmen: Magtymguly Pyragy; Turkish: Mahtumkulu Firaki;[20] c. 1724-1733 – c. 1807) was a Turkmen spiritual leader, philosophical poet, and sufi who is considered to be the father of the Turkmen literature[21] and the most famous figure in Turkmen literary history.<br/>

                Many Turkmens regard Magtymguly's collected works as a pinnacle of Turkmen literature and are often found in the homes of Turkmen-speaking people, who learn his poems by heart and use them as proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have become the subjects of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, and have influenced post-18th century Turkmen writing more than the works of any other author.<br/>

                In a wider context, Magtymguly is often placed alongside major figures of the Turkic literary world such as Hoja Ahmad Yasawi, Yunus Emre, Ali-Shir Nava'i and Fizuli.<br/>

            <h3>Early Life and education</h3>
            <p>
                Magtymguly is thought to have been born in Hajygowshan, a village near Gonbad-e Qabus city in the modern-day province of Golestan, Iran, the northern steppes of which are known as Turkmen Sahra ("Turkmen steppes"). <br/>In his poetry, Magtymguly says; "Tell those who enquire about me that I am a Gerkez, I hail from Etrek and my name is Makhtumkuli",[25] identifying his homeland as the banks of the Etrek River and expressing his identity through his tribe.<br/>

                Magtymguly received his early education in the Persian and Arabic languages from his father Döwletmämmet Azady, a leading Turkmen scholar. His mother's name was probably Orazgül, though this claim is not universally accepted.[27] Magtymguly studied in various madrassahs, including Idris Baba madrassah in the village of Gyzyl Aýak, Şirgazy madrassah in Khiva and "Gögeldaş" madrassah in Bukhara.<br/>

                After returning home, Magtymguly worked as a silversmith, and taught and wrote poetry.[30] He developed a realistic style of writing about 18th-century Turkmens that became very popular and led to him becoming one of the most cherished Turkmen poets of all time. He was a devout naqshbandi sufi who was said to have travelled throughout all of the lands comprising modern Turkmenistan, teaching and praying for the salvation of his people.[31] His strong religiosity and deep sense of spirituality are found in poems such as "Gaşy ýaý" and "Söýmüşem seni".<br/>

                Not much is known about Magtymguly's family life. He was unable to marry Meňli, the woman he loved, although it is thought he married someone else. Several sources state he was forced to marry and take care of the wife of his deceased brother Akgyz.<br/>

                Magtymguly's elder brothers Abdulla and Mahammetsupa disappeared, and his children died young. Magtymguly was also pained by the death of his father, with whom he had maintained close scholarly relations throughout his life.[30] Some of Magtymguly's poetry, along with stories collected from Turkmen oral traditions, suggest he was taken prisoner, likely in Mashhad, Iran. It is unknown who took him captive but such events were common in 18th-century Iran and Turkmenistan. A servant of the ruler, who was also a Turkmen, allegedly aided Magtymguly's escape.<br/>

                Magtymguly was buried in Aktokay, a village in north-eastern Iran.[34] The Iranian government has constructed a mausoleum on his grave.<br/>

                Magtymguly was one of the first Turkmen poets to introduce the use of classical Chagatai, the court language of the Khans of Central Asia, as a literary language, incorporating many Turkmen linguistic features.[39] His poetry exemplifies a trend towards increased use of Turkic languages rather than Persian; he is revered as the founder of Turkmen poetry, literature and language.[40] Magtymguly is widely considered holy among Turkmen communities and his poems are often quoted as proverbs in Turkmen society.<br/>

                Magtymguly made much use of the qoshuk form of poetry, which features prominently in Turkmen folk songs and is easily adapted to Turkmen musical forms. The qoshuk form consists of quatrains with lines consisting of eight or eleven syllables, and follows a rhyming scheme of ABCB for the first stanza, and CCCB and DDDB for the following stanzas. The compatibility of Magtymguly's poems with traditional musical forms allowed them to be easily adopted by bakhshis (traditional singers).<br/>

                Magtymguly's first poem "By night when I was asleep ... Revelation" was composed following an incident that occurred when Magtymguly was a child. His parents were attending a wedding but Magtymguly was sleeping and they left him behind. As he slept, he began to foam at the mouth and his parents were called back to the house. When his father awoke him, Magtymguly recited his first poem.[43] Another of Magtymguly's poems recounts a dream in which Omar Khayyam bestowed upon him the gift of poetic invention.<br/>
